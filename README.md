## General Information

This is my very first attempt at learning Unity. I've tried to apply most of the basics in the game:
 - the logic behind GameObjects
 - scripts and their relations with each other (references)
 - physics of GameObjects (collision detection, rigidbody etc.)
 
## Technologies Used

- Unity ver. 2021.3.14f1

## Features

Some of the core gameplay and functionalities in the flappy bird game:

On screen point system that increments every time a pipe is passed

Game Over screen when the bird collide with the pipe

## Setup

Fork or clone the project using any of your preferred Git CLI or GUI.
Do not download as ZIP file as there are known issues of incorrectly importing assets to a remote Unity workspace.

## Project Status

Project is in progress. I am eager to learn more of Unity and expand my project further.

## Room for Improvement

To do:
- [ ] Add title screen scene (add this scene before the game screen scene in build settings)
- [ ] Make game over screen shows up when the bird goes off the screen
- [ ] Find a fix for the points going up even after game over
- [ ] Add audio for every points added
- [ ] Add background elements (particles system)
- [ ] Add some animations to the bird
